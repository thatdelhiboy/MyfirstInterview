# MyfirstInterview
 
Hi Viewers!!!

This is the first design which I made in a job interview.

1. I was totally not aware what it was supposed to happen. 
2. I thought that they will be asking me questions related to HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, etc.
but it didn't

still I made it. thanks to above photoshop 2015. which I did not know how to use.
just to finish my design with minimal resources I had used following.

1. Snipping tool 
2. Paint (Microsoft) (for txt to images)
2. Google chrome. (For inspecting and making it looking as I want.)

It was confusing in starting "what I was doing?" whether they will like or not.
Date of Interview:-23 Nov 2019 saturday
